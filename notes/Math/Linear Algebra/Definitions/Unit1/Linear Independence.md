# Linear Independence

## Intro

Linear Independence is at the heart of Linear Algebra, it defines when vectors are "dependent" on one another

## Definition

Vectors are independent when no [[1747970140-OUWU|Linear Combination]] gives the zero vector, except the 0 combination. Otherwise, dependent.
$$
c_1x_1+c_2x_2+ ... = 0
$$

## Examples

If more cols than rows then they are guaranteed to be dependent
