# Null space


## Definition

The Null-space is the [[1747970742-TBNT|Subspace]] where $Ax=0$ has solutions that are not the 0 vector. Or in other words. All solutions to this equation, x.

### How is the Null-space a subspace?

- Check that the solutions to the equation $Ax=0$ always give a subspace.
  - Is it closed under addition?
    - Yes. If $Av=0$and $Aw=0$ then $A(v+w)=0$
  - Is it closed under multiplication?
    - Yes: ($A(12v) = 0$)
