# Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt

## Outline

- Orthogonal basis
- Orthogonal matrix Q
- Gram-Schmidt $A \rightarrow Q$

## Orthonormal Vectors

$q_{i}^Tq_j = 0$

## How does [[1748552552-ZUXD|Orthonormal matrices]] help

- Q projected is a lot easier to calculate for its column space, as $Q^TQ$ is $I$

## [[1748555506-KNJK|Gram-Schmidt]]


### Warning

[[1748555506-KNJK|Gram-Schmidt]] creates a lot of square roots.
