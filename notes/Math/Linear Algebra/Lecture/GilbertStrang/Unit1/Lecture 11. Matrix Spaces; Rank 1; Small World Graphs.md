# Lecture 11

## Outline

- Bases of new vector spaces
- Rank one matrices.
- Small world graphs.

## Continuing from [[Lecture 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces|Lecture 10]]

Even though they are matrices, you can still add and multiply them by scalars.

### [[Basis|Basis]] For M = All 3by 3s

Practically the same as $n = 9$ dimensional space.

### [[Dimension|Dimension]] Is 9

### Sum of Two Subspaces

Is the sum of any element in both.\
$dim(S+U) = 9$, got all 3 by 3's= the dimension of intersection and

### Another [[Subspaces|Subspace]] that Isn't Vectors

## Rank One Matrices

### Definition

A rank one matrix has one rank. It has the form of\
$A = uV^T$

### Do Rank 4 Matrices Form a Subspace?

No, the sum of rank 4 matrices are probably not in the subspace.
