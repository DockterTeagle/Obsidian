# Basis
## Definition
A basis for a given [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] is a set of vectors that is both [[Linearly Independent|Linearly Independent]] and also [[Span|spans]] that space
## Example
Space is $\mathbb{R}^3$\
One basis is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\0\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
0\\1\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
0\\0\\1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This set of vectors (and others like it) are called the [[Standard Basis|Standard Basis]]

## The Test
- Is the matrix square and does the [[Column Space|Column Space]] span the whole space?
- Is the matrix [[Invertible|Invertible]]?
## Properties
- Every basis for a given space has the same number of vectors.
