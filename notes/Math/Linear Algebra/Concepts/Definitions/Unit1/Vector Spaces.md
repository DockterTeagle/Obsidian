# Vector Spaces
## Definition
What is a vector space?\
A collection of Vectors that allows vector operations.\
Space is alot of vectors, allows to do the vector operations. allowing [[Linear Combinations|Linear Combinations]] of vectors.\
It must have these properties:
- can add by things
- multiply by numbers
- still in the vector space
## Examples
- $\mathbb{R}^2$ = all 2-dimensional real vectors such as
$$\begin{bmatrix}
0\\0
\end{bmatrix}$$
"The xy plane" 
- $\mathbb{R}^3$ all vectors with 3 real components. such as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}\
3\\2\\0\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- $R^n$ all vectors with real components.
## Rules
- cant remove any vectors in the space, have to be allowed to do a [[Linear Combinations|Linear Combinations]], including multiplying by 0.
- therefore, has the 0 vector inside it.
## Bad Examples
- The first quadrant in $R^2$ is not closed under multiplication and addition
