# Nullspace
## Definition
The Nullspace is the [[1747970742-TBNT|Subspace]] where $Ax=0$ is solved. Or in other words. All solutions to this equation, x.
### How is the Nullspace a Subspace?
- check that the solutions to the equation $Ax=0$ always give a subspace.
  - is it closed under addition?
    - yes. If $Av=0$and $Aw=0$ then $A(v+w)=0$
  - is it closed under multiplication?
    - yes: $A(12v) = 0$
