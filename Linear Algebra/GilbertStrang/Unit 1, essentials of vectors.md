## Different interpretations of linear equations
The system of equations
$$
\begin{align}
2x - y = 0 \\

-x + 2y = 3
\end{align}
$$
can be represented as a matrix like so:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2&-1 \\
-1&2

\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
0\\3
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### The Row Picture
one possible interpretation of this is to think of it in rows. or the intersection of two lines, the "answer" to the problem is the intersection of these lines

### The Column Picture
