# Lecture 10

## Outline

- Correct error in [[Lecture 9. Independence,Basis, and Dimension|Lecture 9]]
- Four Fundamental subspaces for matrix A

## Error from Previous Lecture

The previous matrix, rows were dependent which makes the columns dependent

## [[1748015998-UUDH|The Four Fundamental Subspaces]]

## New type of vector space

The [[1747970035-CTCE|Vector Space]] of all $3x3$ matrices is indeed a vector space.

### Only Operations that are needed

A+B,cA

### Subspaces of M

- All upper triangular matrices.
- Symmetric matrices.
- Diagonal matrices. $dim = 3$.
