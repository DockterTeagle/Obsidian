# Basis
## Definition
A basis for a given [[1747970035-CTCE|vector space]] is a set of vectors that is both [[1747975217-DWCP|Linearly Independent]] and also [[1747974483-BJRX|spans]] that space
## Example
Space is $\mathbb{R}^3$\
One basis is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\0\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
0\\1\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
0\\0\\1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This set of vectors (and others like it) are called the [[1748011171-YKRV|Standard Basis]]

## The Test
- Is the matrix square and does the [[1747973252-MXDM|Column Space]] span the whole space?
- Is the matrix [[1747969147-WQZV|Invertible]]?
## Properties
- Every basis for a given space has the same number of vectors.
